          <p>
            I'm a student at the University of Gloucestershire, completing a
            Bachelors degree in Cyber and Computer Security (hons). I have a
            passion for Cyber Security but my interests extend to automation and
            scripting, web development, Electrical Engineering, Internet of
            things, and a variety of other subjects. Alongside my studies, I
            enjoy teaching myself electronics and creating hardware and software
            projects, as well as taking on code projects to constantly push
            myself.

            I have been asked to design and build multiple bespoke websites. As
            part of this service, I have set up and configured remote hosting
            myself. I have also installed and configured the wordpress CMS and
            taught my clients how to use it to continually update their site
            once I have finished it.

            towards a bachelors degree in
            <strong> Cyber and computer Security</strong>. I am about to begin
            my second year and I will be studying modules on Data Analytics,
            Managing the security of information, Operating Systems,
            Cryptography and Security, Network Design and Configuration, Ethical

            Since taking an A-Level in the subject, I have had a keen interest
            in Electronics. I am particularly interested in
            <strong>IoT</strong> devices and Electronic Secrity Systems.
            Recently, I have become particularly interested in
            <strong>Renewable Energy systems</strong> such as Solar power
            generators and off-grid systems, which I hope to soon create a
            miniature version of as a project.
